- Always modifying roles for missing access is not ideal approach. Instead we assign new role to user which has missing access.
- All details in suim are categorised based out output values.
  - Go to user tab, if you need user as output

- If you have some complex filters, then use : User by Comples Selection Criteria.
  - e.g: user starting with A, belongs to DEMO group and has access to su01
