- When ever access issues happens, ask user to exexute SU53 and share the screenshot, accordingly SECURITY person can modify the user role / assign new role which is having the access.
- Always su53 annot be correct, it only displays the last auth eroor.
  - sometimes it shows p_runtime / s_alv_layo / s_alv_layr / s_tcode
  - In such conditions, we use trace

### Switch ON trace for user: stauthtrace
- we get successful and missing authorizations for user
